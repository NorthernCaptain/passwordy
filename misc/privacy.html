        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated: Aug 10, 2024</strong></p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Passwordy, the offline password manager (the "App"). Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data and your privacy rights when using our App. Please read this policy carefully before using Passwordy.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>We respect your privacy, and as such, Passwordy does not collect any personal or non-personal information from users. Specifically, we do not collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Names</li>
            <li>Email addresses</li>
            <li>Phone numbers</li>
            <li>Location data</li>
            <li>Device information</li>
            <li>Usage statistics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Rest assured that your data remains completely private, and no information is ever transmitted or shared with any third party.</p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect any information, there is no data to use, share, or sell to third parties. Passwordy is designed to operate entirely offline, and all your secrets remain on your device unless you choose to sync them with your own Google Drive account.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Passwordy does not integrate with or use any third-party services or APIs that may collect data from you. Your data remains within your control, and we do not share it with any external entities. If you access third-party services through the App (e.g., via Google Drive for syncing), please review their privacy policies to understand how they handle your information.</p>

        <h2>5. Security</h2>
        <p>Even though Passwordy does not collect data, we take the security of our App seriously. We use industry-standard security measures to ensure that any data processed by our App, such as passwords and secrets stored in the encrypted database, remains secure and protected from unauthorized access.</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>We are committed to protecting children's privacy. Passwordy is not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately so that we can take appropriate action.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any changes will be posted in the App, and the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page will indicate the most recent revision. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your privacy.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or feedback regarding this Privacy Policy or the App, please do not hesitate to contact us via email at <a href="mailto:NavalClash@gmail.com">NavalClash@gmail.com</a>. We are here to help and will respond to your inquiries as promptly as possible.</p>
